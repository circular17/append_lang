# append-lang README

Append is a programming language crafted on the core philosophy of appending actions directly to data, promoting a harmonious blend of functional and fluent design principles.

## Features

**Simplicity and Brevity**: Distilled to its essence, Append strips away redundant symbols, offering a succinct syntax tailored for frequently-used constructs.

**Unified Paradigms**: Seamlessly merging the functional and object-oriented programming paradigms, Append introduces innovative elements to maximize convenience and utility.
